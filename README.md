PURPOSE

The device described here is intended to mix two gasses.  One gas is injected into the device through the center port.  The other gas is drawn in through the side ports.  This is a form of injector pump - the flow of the first gas and the geometry creates suction which draws in the second gas.

The device is intended to operate at flow rates between 0 and 40 lpm at the outlet, and mixes the gasses in roughly equal amounts (by volume at standard temperature and pressure) at most flow rates.  

In particular, the gasses may be oxygen and air.

DISCLAIMER

This is not a medical device, and is not intended to be used as part of a medical device.  It is especially not intended to be used in critical life support equipment.  It comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.  If you build it and use it, you do so at your own risk.  If you build devices incorporating this design and use them for any application, it is up to you to verify the performance is suitable for your application and complies with all applicable laws.

CONSTRUCTION

In order for these to work, they need to have fairly precise tolerances of the channels where the gas flows.  In particular, any of the cross-sectional areas (including the injector hole) should be within 5-10% of the cross section shown.  That means that the tolerances in some areas are 0.05mm or preferably 0.02mm.  Additionally, the walls should be smooth, especially where the cross section is narrowest.  Deviations would result in a mix ratio different from 50%, and/or a mix ratio that varies with flow.

The parts can be injection molded, milled (with a very small cutter), or possibly 3D printed.  The easiest is injection molding plus a milling step for the side ports and thread.  If 3D printed, SLS or MJF are probably best; the injector channel should be undersized in the print, and expanded with a steel pin in order to get the exact size and shape.

The material is not critical.  However, if one of the gasses used is oxygen, the material must be oxygen compatible.  There are many materials which will SPONTANEOUSLY IGNITE in pure oxygen at moderate pressures.  It is up to you to VERIFY THE OXYGEN COMPATIBILITY of the specific material you use.  Probably okay: brass, stainless steels, nylon, (some) polycarbonates.  Probably NOT OK: carbon steels, aluminum, most other plastics.  Make SURE there is no residual lubricant from machining or any other organic contaminants left on the parts.
